I like desserts, Apfelkuchen looks like something I would like to try.
I should check the local Baeckerei
I don't like Brot though, it's too dry.
I give all my Brot to my Hund. 
The Baeckerei has many different Gebaeck that I think that I would like.
Oh wow that BMW sure is flying by!
I decide to share a Bratwurst with my Hund.
I bought pastries from Berlin.
I got pastry crumbs on my Lederhose.
