I like desserts, Apfelkuchen looks like something I would like to try.
I should check the local Baeckerei
I don't like Brot though, it's too dry.
I give all my Brot to my Hund. 
The Baeckerei has many different Gebaeck that I think that I would like.
I would like to buy pastries in Berlin.
I got pastry crumbs on my Lederhose.
